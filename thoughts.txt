- A Key corresponds to a single keypress by the user:
  - A single ASCII byte, such as "a" (97)
  - A series of bytes corresponding to a single Unicode character, such
    as "Ã¦" (195,166), "áœ" (225,143,156), or "í í°¦" (240,144,144,166)
- A Sequence is a specific series of Keys
  - An escape sequence in an editor, such as:
    M-Ã¦ (27, (195,166))
  - A cheat sequence in a game, such as:
    â†’â†‘â†’ (M[C-M[A-M[C) ((27,91,67), (27,91,65), (27,91,67))

- Not sure how to handle the fact that Unicode needs multiple bytes of input
  - Will I have to have some sort of global loop?
    - Time pauses 'tween bytes to form Key objects, synchronize `doupdate` calls
      for perceived speed
    - Pain in the ass
      - Ruby Threads? Seriously? >,>
  - What about a *single*, *central* global loop?
    - Something like Rack that handles "the Loop" for everything that needs it
      (EventMachine, XMPP4R, Rack, and Nfoiled?)
    - Any library can schedule things to work during the loop, all must be non-
      blocking etc
  - What about popping a thread everytime a non-ASCII byte is read?
    - Do all Unicode characters start with a non-ASCII byte? How are they
      sequential? (for #succ, etc)
    - I could pop a `Thread`, and instruct it to `gets` until it receives a
      nil, indicating the byte sequence is over.
      - Do Unicode characters of different byte-lengths pad with nils to a
        specific number of bytes? Try turning back on the display of `nil`s
        and let's see.
      - Do all terminals send the bytes of a unicode character fast enough to
        prevent intervening cyclings of `gets`? Must experiment on a really
        fast computer.
      - What if you were to provide input so fast as to prevent an successive
        nil? Is that possible? Must experiement with pasting Unicode
        characters/typing very fast.
      - If for some reason the user had turned back on `delay` mode or set a
        non-zero`wtimeout`, we'd have to retreive and save that value, then
        switch into `nodelay` mode; retreive the Unicode bytes; and re-set
        their preferred input mode.
      - If we're already in a `gets` loop ... we'd have to have an 'input
        lock' of some sort, to ensure that the `gets` from the original input
        loop doesn't accidentally 'steal' a byte from the middle of the
        Unicode series. (and recognize it as a Unicode byte, and start a new
        `Thread`, and ... so on)
      - Speed concerns involving popping a new thread for every Unicode
        character. Will have to benchmark a bit.
    - Would mean we couldn't handle `doupdate` calls in a sexy way ... have to
      leave that up to the user. Which is probably fine anyway, I guess, just
      doesn't feel as sexy.
